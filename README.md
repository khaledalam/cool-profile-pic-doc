## Reflection
The idea of automate changing facebook, twitter github, etc.. profile picture came to my mind few days ago, I decided to build this self project from A to Z using some new strategy and stack as a proof of concept of some things that I want to proof personally by myself.

## Solved Challenges
- Connections between containers issues
- Deadlock issues
- Sockets issues
- Caching common dependencies

Current demo is version 1 of the app


## Version 2 Tweeks:
- use multi workers, publisher, queues, taskers
- mapping DB queries by its types and priority
- improve containerization performance
- design IP blocker microservice
- design mailer microservice 
- handle higher traffic and load
- automate the deployment process and increase its speed
